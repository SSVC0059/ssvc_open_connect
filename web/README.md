# Svelte DEMO app

This is a DEMO application that serves the purpose of being able to demonstrate the capabilities of SvelteESP32.

With minimal functionality, it can emulate a working Svelte application, which has the translated application in the DIST folder, which can be installed on the ESP32. Thus, ESP32 can serve this reactive application consisting only of HTML, JS and CSS files.
# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
